1) Updated 'show boundaries' toolbar bitmap and tooltip text.

SA - 3.1.0.94 7/27/2014
1) Tweaked "Insert Silence" feature to place stop cursor at beginning of wave data following the silence section.
2) Converted popup menu for displaying/hiding transcription bars into a popup dialog.
3) Modified operation of "graphs/view/segment boundaries" so that 'this graph', 'no graphs' and 'waveform only' follow what is displayed.
4) Added 'view boundaries' to transcription popup menu and moved location of 'show transcription editor'.
5) sorted 'file/export' menu to alphabetical order.

SA - 3.1.0.93 7/24/2014
1) Added capability to draw transcription boundaries

SA - 3.1.0.92 7/15/2014

2) Changed enabling and disabling of playback toolbar buttons so that the button that initiated the playback
is the only one enabled during a 'pause' of the record.
3) Enabled auto-scrolling for all playback modes except 'playback window'

SA - 3.1.0.91 4/8/2014
1) Install fixes for help files.

SA - 3.1.0.90 4/7/2014
1) Added Training and Samples subdirectories to install.
2) Updated text on first page of ELAN import dialog sequence.

SA - 3.1.0.89 3/31/2014
1) Added rudimentary ELAN support.

SA - 3.1.0.88 3/16/2014
1) After using Alt-Z or Alt-X, the software now automatically selects the PL1 segment that was just created.
2) Updated the player and the tool bar icons to show the new 'Play End Cursor->File End' feature addted in 3.1.0.87
3) Fixed a GPF that was occuring with the new large word lists.  The error occurred because the CObjectIStream class used a buffer with a fix size of 32,000 bytes, regardless of the incoming file size.
4) The 'Locate Word' feature now automatically clears the Ref, Phonemic, Tone and Ortho segments before processing
5) Import file now allows .txt files as a default file type.
6) Fixed a 'Locate Words' bug that was causing a crash in some files.  The crash is caused with the detected word to be created has a duration that is the exact same size of the segment being created, causing the segment end to be at the same location as the next segment start.  This causes the next segment calculation to fail.  The issue was resolved by 'pushing' the next segment ahead, if it's start overlaps the previous segments stop location.

SA - 3.1.0.87 3/6/2014
1) Added feature to automatic scroll wave form during playback - specifically when playing between the end cursor and the end of the file.
2) Modified menu wording.
3) Converted SA_ENU.dll to a 'resource only' DLL.

SA - 3.1.0.86 2/24/2014
1) Added Alt-X feature to be used for quickly marking up stories in a wave file.

SA - 3.1.0.85 2/19/2014
1) Added capability to save stereo files as mono audio files via the 'SaveAs' dialog box.  The user has the option to select the left or right channel for saving.

SA - 3.1.0.84 1/20/2014
1) Fixed segment rendering problem that occurs when stereo audio files are used.  The bug was introduced in 3.1.083.
2) Implemented partial change for stereo-to-mono conversion.  The 'SaveAs' dialog has been modified.  The conversion checks are in place, but the conversion function has been disabled.
3) Refactored the code that references the SaParm structure into a class.  The code was modified to reduce the usage of the structure as much as possible.

SA - 3.1.0.83 1/8/2014
1) Added code to check for segments that are beyond the end of the audio data when the segments are loaded on a file-open.  A message is displayed if bad segments are found.  The bad segments are ignored.

SA - 3.1.0.81 1/6/2014
1) Added support for UTF16 (BE&LE) that are encountered during the import process.  UTF32 files are disallowed.  UTF16 files will cause a warning message to be displayed but the contents will be converted and imported.
2) Removed dependency on sfSettings.DLL.  The code has been imported in the main SA project.
3) Updated application copyright dates.
4) Fixed build problem. C# projects (speechtoolsutils.dll, yeti.mmedia.dll, yeti.wmfsdk.dll and st_audio.dll) were not getting harvested.  The binaries in the install were outdated from 9/2013.

SA - 3.1.0.80 11/27/2013 (Stereo Branch)
1) Added menu item for 'Auto Add' feature
2) Added checks, messages and conversion functions for UTF16 BE&LE files.  The transcription alignment feature still does not support UTF16 files properly, but most other import functions now provide checks and conversions for UTF16.  The code will not currently properly identify UTF-32.  If the unicode BOM is not provided at the beginning of the file, and the data contains characters > 0x7f, the file will be treated as UTF-8 without warning.
3) Fixed the crash that prevents the display of the Duration graph type.
4) Fixed 'SaveAs' menuitem problem.  SaveAs was disabled for stereo files for no apparent reason.

SA - 3.1.0.79 11/17/2013 (Stereo Branch)
1) Fixed find/replace bug that occurs when user changes 'find' value on initial selection.  The subsequent search will fail to select a value if the 'find' value is a partial match within the currently selected string.
2) Fixed bug which prevented SA from finding the current FieldWorks project directory during an export.  The code now recursively searches both the 32 and 64-bit registry hives for the 'ProjectsDir' value.  FieldWorks names it's registry keys according to version. The new code enumerates over this key.  If SA is unable to find the key, it will attempt to use either the "ProgramData" default FW path on MS Vista and above, or the "Application Data" path for XP.  If that fails, a warning will be posted and the user will be allowed to select an alternate path.
3) Fixed a bug that prevented the 'Import SFM' feature from importing reference numbers in a SFM file.
	
SA - 3.1.0.78 11/03/2013 (Stereo Branch)
1) Fixes for interface with IPA Help.  
1a) Modified the message:
	'No resources found, exiting.' 
	to read 
	'Speech Analyzer was unable to locate or use SA_ENU.DLL or SA_LOC.DLL.\nIt will now exit.'
	
1c) There was a buffer length problem that was preventing the code from correctly parsing parameters received in the batch file.  This resulted in the wrong graph types being displayed.
1d) NOTE!!!! IPA Help needs to be run with 'Windows XP SP3' compatibility mode under Windows 7 and later.  If it is not,
a message will be displayed when Speech Analyzer is unable to located the batch file.  
The message is:
	The file:
	'C:\Program Files (x86)\Speech Tools\IPA-Help\IPA-Help.lst'
	was specified on the command line, but it does not exist.
	If you are using IPA Help on Windows 7 or later, please use the compatibility mode for Windows XP.
	Speech Analyzer will now exit.

Without the compatibility mode set, the file will be put in:
C:\Users\yournamegoeshere\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Speech Tools\IPA-Help\ipa-help.lst 
by IPA Help.

SA - 3.1.0.73 - 9/19/2013 (stereo branch)
1) Renamed links for help documents from *.doc to *.pdf.
2) Corrected scrolling problem in Find dialog box feature.  The code was not properly setting the position parameter in the windows message, so all scrolling updates were effectively disabled.

SA - 3.1.0.72 - 9/17/2013 (stereo branch)
1) Update waveform selection feature so that the start/stop cursors are hidden during selection and redrawn when left mouse button is released.  The start and stop cursors are placed at the edges of the highlight region when the selection is completed.
2) Modified code to avoid GPF when transcription data is imported but fields are missing.
3) Fixed crash that occurs during a PasteAsNew when more than one Phrase Level transcription is copied (more than one for one level).
4) Modified text on InsertSilence dialog box.

SA - 3.1.0.71 - 9/12/2013 (stereo branch)
1) Fixed GPF that occurs during transcription alignment if a field is selected that does not exist in the data.  The software will now insert a '?' for fields that are missing in the data.
2) Fixed copy/paste alignment issues.  There were several problems.
  a) The software wasn't calculating the end of the source file correctly, causing an overflow in the math of the length of the data to be copied.  In some cases, no data was copied, yet the system still updated the length of the new file to what the length should be.  this caused display problems.
  b) The software wasn't handling the offset and duration for stereo files correctly when adjusting the annotation segments.
  c) The system wasn't calculating the new position of the stop cursor after the paste operation for a stereo file.
  d) When adjusting the annotations, the software was improperly modifying the old-last segment if the new segment was pasted to the right and outside of it's boundary.

SA - 3.1.0.70 - 9/9/2013 (stereo branch)
1) Corrected menu/resource problem which was preventing InsertSilence feature from operating correctly.

SA - 3.1.0.68 - 9/4/2013 (stereo branch)
1) Fixed transcription mis-alignment bug.  For stereo files only, this bug occurred when the data was written to the .saxml file.  The gloss, reference and POS transcriptions were not written with the correct offset and length.  This also caused improper segment indexing when trying to determine the segment number of the transcription.  Gloss, reference and POS transcription lengths are written in the 'MarkDuration' field of the .saxml.

SA - 3.1.0.67 - 9/3/2013 (stereo branch)
1) Fixed transcription mis-alignment bug.  Caused by SpeechToolUtils dll because it wasn't able to read a Broadcast Wave Format meta tag.
2) Fixed reference numbering problem that occurs when importing reference numbers start at a gloss position beyond the first gloss.  Because the reference indexes were empty at the start of the operation, the synchronization between the reference segments and gloss segments was broke.  Added code to insert empty reference segments for the skipped positions if one doesn't exist already.

SA - 3.1.0.66 - 9/2/2013 (stereo branch)
1) Fixed buffer overrun bug in CObjectIStream

5) Added code to cleanup ~#!tstWrite!#~ test file.
6) Removed some debug code that was writing files to c:\working when the formant tracker is invoked (spectrogram).
7) Fixed a bug in SpeechToolUtils that makes it look like a transcription file is saved when the following steps are performed.  The file is not actually saved.
  a) mark transcription file as 'readonly' in windows
  b) open SA
  c) modify transcription

1) Modified autosave to save a .info file which provides the original source directory to be used for file restoration.
2) Modified autosave so that the user is prompted on startup concerning autosave files.  They will be queried for each autosave file as to whether or not to recover the file, and in the case of recordings, they will be asked to supply a directory to save the file into.
3) Modified autosave to avoid saving .wav files if the file size hasn't changed.
4) Modified autosave to stop deleting autosave files when the user performs a 'save' or 'saveas' operation in SA.

SA - 3.1.0.45 - 3/28/2013
1) Fixed GPF in SFM import feature that occurs if any of the transcription fields (or/pm/ph/gl) are missing.

1) Fix for AutoRef where code was validating 'end' value before it had been loaded from control.
2) Modified validation of auto ref 'begin' and 'end' parameters.

NOTE:  The following rules are used:
'begin' - must be >=0 and <= 10000.
'end' - must be >= begin and <= 10000.
The code internally limits the actual iterations to the number of gloss segments on the screen, so if the 'end' number is beyond the actual gloss count, the logic will terminate at the correct point - the last gloss word.

3) Modified the way defaults are stored for the autoref dialog.  They are now stored in the registry.
4) Widened the TAT dialog box.
5) Fixed bugs in TAT that occur when a user tries to reimport the same or a different file on the second page (when using reference numbers).  The edit field would always be blank because the internal data structure was in an uninitialized state to the second import, cause errors.
Also, if the user imports another file, and it successfully loads, it will be set as the default.
