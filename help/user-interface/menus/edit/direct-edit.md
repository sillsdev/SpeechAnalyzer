You can edit a transcription with **Direct Edit** or [Transcription Editor](transcription/editor). With **Direct Edit**, you can begin typing *directly* into a selected segment. For complex scripts, such as IPA, a different [keyboard layout](transcription/keyboards) is required.

- If you change edit modes, de-select the segment of interest by clicking anywhere in the graph area to *save* any recently edited data.
- To change edit modes, de-select the edited segment, switch edit modes, and select a segment.

To activate **Direct Edit**, do one of the following:

1. [Select a segment](select-segment).
1. To activate **Direct Edit** mode, do one of the following:
   * On the **Edit** menu, point to [Transcription](transcription/overview), and then click **Direct Edit**.
   * Click the selected segment, *a second time*.
   * Press **F2**.

    The transcription text turns white and highlights.

1. To activate **Direct Edit** mode, and *clear the transcription text*, press the **Spacebar**.

    The transcription text turns white and an empty box replaces the text.

1. Type any needed text.
1. To leave **Direct Edit** mode, press **Enter**, or click another segment.
