title: Segment Boundaries
---

On the **Edit** menu, you can [resize transcription segment boundaries](segment-resizing) by clicking **Segment Boundaries**. This prevents the creation of gaps (islands) while editing. Boundaries remain touching; as one segment expands, its neighbor shrinks (co-dependent pairs).

- To turn [segment](segment) boundaries off and on, do any of the following:
  - On the [Edit](overview) menu, click **Segment Boundaries**.
  - On the [toolbar](../../toolbar/overview), click **Edit Boundaries** ![](../../../images/060.png).
  - Press **Insert**.

- To create a *co-dependent pair* from non-touching adjacent segments, hold down the **Alt** key and drag one of the cursors, until it touches the border of the other segment.
- Resizing one segment may also resize other segments whose widths are dependent upon the one you are resizing.
- You can move a common segment border, but the *end border remains fixed*.
