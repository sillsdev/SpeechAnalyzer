title: Add Phrase Level
---

The Phrase Level transcription bars are used for music analysis in several hierarchical levels (for example, phrases, sections, verses, and so on), **L1** being the highest, **L4** the lowest. Phrase Level segment boundaries are independent of all others.

To create a phrase level segment, do the following:

1. Select a [Melogram](../../graphs/types/music/melogram) to display.
1. To position the phase level transcription, in the **Melogram** graph, position the begin cursor to the beginning of a phrase and the end cursor at the end of the phrase.
1. To display an empty phrase level transcription bar, on the **Graphs** menu, point to **Transcription**, point to the **Phrase Level** number, and then select on which graphs the bar displays (for example, **All Graphs**).
1. On the **Edit** menu, point to [Transcription](overview), and then select the *same* **Phrase Level** segment number selected on the **Graphs** menu (for example, if you displayed the **Phrase Level 3** transcription, select **Add Phrase L3 Segment**).
1. To create a transcription for the selected phrase, you can use [Direct Edit](../direct-edit) or [Transcription Editor](editor).
