title: Add Gloss Bookmark
---

You can add a bookmark to flag an area of a recording for future reference. You can add as many bookmarks as you need.

Bookmarks are helpful if you want to return to a specific area of your data after an interruption. For example, if data is not clear, you can bookmark an area, and return to it when you have more information.

To insert a bookmark, do the following:

1. Select a [Raw Waveform graph](../../graphs/types/raw-waveform) to display.
1. [Select a segment](../select-segment), in the **Gloss** transcription bar, to indicate the placement of the bookmark character.
1. Do one of the following:
   * On the **Edit** menu, point to [Transcription](overview), and then click **Add Gloss Bookmark**.
   * Right-click in the **Phonetic** transcription bar, and then click **Add Bookmark**.
   * Press **Ctrl+B**.

The **Gloss** [transcription bar](guidelines) appears with a bookmark character ( ! ) to the left of the segment.
