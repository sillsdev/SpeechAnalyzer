title: Update All Boundaries
---

Use **Update All Boundaries** to recalculate the beginning and end of segments to [Fragments](../../graphs/fragment) (Pitch Periods).

- On the **Edit** menu, point to **Transcription**, and then click **Update All Boundaries**.

**Update All Boundaries** remains unavailable, as long as Speech Analyzer can recompute boundaries automatically.
