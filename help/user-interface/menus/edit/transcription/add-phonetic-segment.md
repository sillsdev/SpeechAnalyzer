title: Add Phonetic Segment
---

To add a new phonetic segment, do the following:

1. [Select a segment](../select-segment), or any unsegmented area with the [begin and end cursor](../../graphs/begin-end-cursors).
1. Do one of the following:
   * On the **Edit** menu, point to [Transcription](overview), and then click **Add Phonetic Segment**.
   * On the [toolbar](../../../toolbar/toolbar), click **Add Phonetic Segment** ![](../../../../images/057.png).
   * Right-click in the **Phonetic** area, and then click **Add Phonetic**.
   * Press **Alt+=**

In the **Phonetic** area, a new segment appears. If you selected a segment, a 100 millisecond phonetic segment appears to the right of the selected segment.

1. Use [Direct Edit](../direct-edit) or [transcription editor](editor) to add a phonetic title in the **Phonetic** area.
1. You might need to [resize the segment](../segment-resizing).

#### ![](../../../../images/001.png) **Tip**
- To listen more slowly to the sound you transcribe, *before deciding upon a character*, on the [Playback](../../playback/overview) menu, click [Player](../../playback/player), in the **Play** list select **Between Cursors**,** and then adjust the **Speed** slider.
- If you are performing length analysis, segment boundary placement is very important.

#### ![](../../../../images/001.png) **Note**
- If the area selected is less than 20 milliseconds, **Add Phonetic Segment** is disabled.
- You can [Undo or Redo](../undo-redo) adding or removing a Phonetic segment.
- To *readjust* the segment boundaries, on the [toolbar](../../../toolbar/toolbar), click **Edit Boundaries** ![](../../../../images/060.png).
- To *see* segment boundaries, on the **Graphs** menu, point to [View](../../graphs/view), and point to **Segment Boundaries**.
