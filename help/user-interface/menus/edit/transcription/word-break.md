You can insert a word break character (#), by doing the following:

1. [Select a segment](../select-segment) to indicate the placement of the word break character.

The word break character (#) will appear *to the left* of the transcription character.

1. On the [Transcription Editor](editor) dialog box, in the **Add Gloss** area, click **Word**.

A word break character (#) appears in the **Gloss** taskbar.

- Alternatively, you can point to **Transcriptions** on the **Edit** menu, and click [Add Gloss Word Segment](add-gloss-word-segment).
- If a transcription character is [bookmarked](add-gloss-bookmark), the word break character (#) is replaced by the book mark character (!).
- You can use the word break character (#) in *Phonology Assistant* as an indication of phonological word boundaries in recorded speech. This is the equivalent of putting a space character between a string of phonetic characters.
