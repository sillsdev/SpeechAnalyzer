To type Unicode characters that do not appear on your keyboard, especially in the transcription bars, you might need to install different keyboard layouts. For example, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

- Tavultesoft Keyman is a computer program that can help you install and use keyboard layouts.

Speech Analyzer provides a Keyman keyboard developed by the Non-Roman Script Initiative (NRSI) for typing IPA characters.

- Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) allows you to create, modify, and install custom keyboards.

Speech Analyzer provides a MSKLC keyboard developed by the Non-Roman Script Initiative (NRSI) for typing IPA characters.
