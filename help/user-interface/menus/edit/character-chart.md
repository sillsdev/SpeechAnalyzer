In Speech Analyzer, you can add a time-aligned IPA transcription to the speech recording using the 1996 version of the International Phonetic Alphabet. There is also support for adding time-aligned Phonemic, Orthographic and Gloss [transcriptions](transcription/guidelines).

The **Character Chart** dialog box appears when you click **IPA Chart** on the [Transcription Editor](transcription/editor) or [Find and Replace](find) dialog boxes. When you use the character chart with **Transcription Editor**, you *must first* [select a segment](select-segment).

To use the **Character Chart** dialog box, do one of the following:

1. Click the **Vowels**, **Consonants**, **Diacritics**, or **Suprasegmentals** tab.

    A different chart displays with each tab.

1. To compare **Character Chart** sounds with the selected segment, select any of the following, and place the cursor over an IPA character:
   1. To hear a sample IPA sound, select the **Sound** check box.
   1. To hear the gloss segment containing the selected segment, select the **Word** check box.
   1. To hear the selected *segment*, select the **Segment** check box.

    A *larger* character image appears, and the sound plays

1. To add a character in the **Click to add characters** box, left-click an IPA character.

    The IPA character appears in the **Click items in the chart to add characters** box.

1. Click **OK**.

    The contents of the **Click items in the chart to add characters** box transfers to the **Find**, **Replace** or **Transcription Editor** dialog box. In Transcription Editor, *the segment title changes*.
