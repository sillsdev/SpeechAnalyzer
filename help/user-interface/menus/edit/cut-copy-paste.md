### **To copy an audio portion**
1. [Select a segment](select-segment) or [select a waveform portion](select-waveform) you want to copy, and then do one of the following:
   * On the **Edit** menu, click **Copy**, or press the [shortcut key](../../shortcuts/overview) **Ctrl+C**.
   * On the **Edit** menu, click **Cut**, or press the shortcut key **Ctrl+X**.
1. Move the insertion point to the destination where you want to copy the item.

    If you want to copy the item to *another document*, or application, switch to the destination document (or application).

1. On the **Edit** menu, click **Paste**, or press the [shortcut key](../../shortcuts/overview) **Ctrl+V**.

### **To copy pitch, intensity and formant measurements to Microsoft Excel**
1. Position the begin cursor or select a waveform portion where you want to take the measurements.
1. On the **Edit** menu, click **Copy Measurements**, or press the [shortcut key](../../shortcuts/overview) **Ctrl+Shift+C**.

    Measurements copy to the Clipboard in tab-delimited format. This is ideal for copying into a spreadsheet application, such as Microsoft Excel.

    If a waveform portion was selected, the average measurements for that portion copy to the Clipboard.

1. Switch to Microsoft Excel.
1. Use the paste feature in Microsoft Excel.

### **To copy a music notation**
1. On the [Staff](../graphs/types/music/staff), drag the mouse pointer over the selected note(s) to copy or cut, and then do one of the following:
   * On the [Staff shortcut menu](../graphs/types/music/staff-shortcut-menu), click **Copy**, or press the [shortcut key](../../shortcuts/overview) **Ctrl+C.**
   * On the Staff shortcut menu, click **Cut**, or press the [shortcut key](../../shortcuts/overview) **Ctrl+X**.
1. Move the insertion point to the destination where you want to copy the item.

    If you want to copy the item to *another document*, or application, switch to the destination document (or application).

1. On the [Staff shortcut menu](../graphs/types/music/staff-shortcut-menu), click **Paste**, or press the [shortcut key](../../shortcuts/overview) **Ctrl+V**.

    You can paste a music notation into text editors or word processors. If a program supports Rich Text data, the notes will be pasted in RTF format. Otherwise, they will be pasted in their data (TXT) format

#### ![](../../../images/001.png)Â **Tip**
- To *move* an item, you can *copy* it from the source location, *paste* it to the destination, and then *delete* it from the source location. This procedure works the same as **Cut** and **Paste**, and minimizes *accidentally* deleting audio data.
- To paste data into a new file, instead of a current file, on the **Edit** menu, click [Paste as New](paste).
