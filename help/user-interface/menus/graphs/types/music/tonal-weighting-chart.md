title:  Tonal Weighting Chart
---

The **Tonal Weighting Chart** is a histogram of pitches in a melody for [music analysis](analysis).

The chart displays intervals smaller than Western semitones. A *semitone* represents a half step on a musical scale.

- You can determine the scale (or tonal inventory) of a melody.
- You can [measure the tonal center](measure-tonal-center) (if one exists) of a melody.

The horizontal scale displays the number of occurrences of a frequency value.

The vertical axis displays fundamental frequency. It aligns with the [Melogram](melogram).

  - Pitch of the zero line in semitones.
  - Difference in pitch between the private cursor\* and the zero line.
  - Pitch at the private cursor\* in semitones.

The nearest musical [note](note-reference-chart) is in parentheses.
