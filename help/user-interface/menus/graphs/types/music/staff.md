title:  Staff

On the **Staff**, you can transcribe Western music notation corresponding to rhythm and pitch patterns. Speech Analyzer has MIDI capabilities, but it is *not* designed as a music publishing tool.

Music notation is a standardized system of writing for music, involving notes, clefs, sharps, flats, and other symbols. Speech Analyzer supports quarter-tone accidentals.

To [transcribe notes to the Staff](transcribe-notes), you can do either of the following:

- [Type the music notation](notation).
- Right-click in the **Staff**, and then select a note on the [Staff shortcut menu](staff-shortcut-menu).

At the left of the **Staff**, you can do any of the following:

|**To**|**Click**|

- Music transcription data is stored in a file with a .music.xml extension in the same folder as the audio file.
- On the [status bar](../../../tools/status-bar), the two panes display:
  - The beginning time interval.
  - The time between the [begin and end cursors](../../begin-end-cursors).
- **Convert** only works for *monophonic* recording, that is, only one singer or one instrument and no accompaniment.
- **Convert** does not create half sharps, half flats, 1 1/2 sharps and 1 1/2 flats.
- When the beginning of the data is not visible, the [clef](clefs) becomes gray.
