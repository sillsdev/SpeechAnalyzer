To support [music analysis](analysis), Speech Analyzer provides the following graphs.

### **Main graphs**
- The [Melogram](melogram) displays the contour of a melody.
- The [Tonal Weighting Chart](tonal-weighting-chart) is a histogram of the pitches in a melody.
- The [Magnitude graph](magnitude) displays the intensity of the melody relative to a reference sound.
- On the [Staff](staff), you can transcribe Western music notation corresponding to rhythm and pitch patterns.

### **Supporting graphs**
- The [Position View graph](../position-view) displays the entire waveform, even if you [zoom](../../zoom) other graphs.
- The [Raw Waveform graph](../raw-waveform) displays the unprocessed sound picked up by the microphone. If necessary, you can delete non-musical material from the beginning and end of the audio file.
