title:  Melogram and Staff examples
---

The [Melogram](melogram) displays the contour of a melody for [music analysis](analysis).

On the [Staff](staff), you can transcribe Western music notation corresponding to rhythm and pitch patterns.

If you can read music notation but are not familiar with Melograms, you can study the following examples to improve your understanding.

The examples consist of *Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star*. Two examples are the output of a synthesizer. The third example is a recording of a male voice.

For each example, study the Melogram and Staff artifically aligned to emphasize the relationship between the fundamental frequency contour and the transcribed notes, and then compare to the music graphs as they actually appear in Speech Analyzer.
