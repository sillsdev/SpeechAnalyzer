title: Raw Waveform graph
---

A *waveform* is an audio recording and the graph of its samples. It can also refer to the audio file that contains the recording.

The **Raw Waveform** graph displays the unprocessed sound picked up by the microphone. Time is on the horizontal axis and air pressure variations are on the vertical axis. Because a screen pixel on the horizontal axis might represent many sound samples, the maximum and minimum values are plotted. *Pressure* is the force per unit area applied on a surface.

To adjust the display of audio data, you can do any of the following:

- Use [toolbar](../../../toolbar/toolbar) buttons.
- Use the [shortcut keys to control zoom](../../../shortcuts/zoom).
- Use the [shortcut keys for view control](../../../shortcuts/view).
- Use the [Zoom](../zoom) function
- Use the [Magnify](../magnify) function.

- If you right-click the plot area, and then click **Parameters**, the **Graph Parameters** dialog box appears with the [Waveform tab](../parameters/waveform-tab) selected.
- On the [status bar](../../tools/status-bar), the four panes display:
  - The beginning time interval.
  - The time between the [begin and end cursor](../begin-end-cursors).
  - The amplitude at the begin cursor.
  - The amplitude at the end cursor.
- To select the graph area between the [begin and end cursors](../begin-end-cursors), press **Ctrl+A**.
- By default, Speech Analyzer shows the **Phonetic** transcription bar on the **Raw Waveform** graph.
- The [Position View graph](position-view) displays the *position of the currently displayed data* within the *entire* file.
