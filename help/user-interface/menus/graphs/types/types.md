Speech Analyzer can display 19 different graphs, but you can *only select 6 graphs* to display at a time (plus the [Position View graph](position-view)).

1. To display the **Graph Types** dialog box, do one of the following:
   * On the **Graphs** menu, click **Types**.
   * On the [toolbar](../../../toolbar/toolbar), click **Graph Types** ![](../../../../images/061.png).
   * Press **F7**.
1. To see the pre-selected graph configurations for *speech*, do one of the following:
   * Click the **Phonetic** tab, and then select an entry in the **screen configuration** list.
   * Click the **Phonetic** [taskbar](../../tools/options/taskbar) pane, and then click an icon.
1. To see the pre-selected graph configurations for *music*, do one of the following:
   * Click the **Music** tab, and then select an entry in the **screen configuration** list.
   * Click the **Music** taskbar pane, and then click an icon.
1. If the **Phonetic** or **Music** lists do not contain the set of graphs you need, click [Custom](custom), select the desired graph types, and then click **OK**.

Reopen the **Graph Types** dialog box. If the **screen configuration** list does not contain the currently displayed *custom* set of graphs, click **Save Current**.

- You can always click **Remove** on the **screen configuration** list to remove a selected graph list or music option.
- To replace one [graph type](overview) with another, right-click in the plot area of a graph, point to **Types**, and then select a different graph type.
- After you select a defined or custom set of graphs, Speech Analyzer saves the configuration to a .psa file.
- On the [startup tab](../../tools/options/startup-tab) of the **Options** dialog box, you can tell Speech Analyzer to **Permanently** or **Temporarily** save selected graphs sets.
