A *graph* is a window that displays a specific type of information about the current sound (such as the pitch or spectrum), including the plot area and the X and Y axes. A *plot* is the data points or symbols contained in a graph that may be connected by a line (plot line), and the area that contains them (plot area).

In Speech Analyzer, you can display the [active](../active-graph) file in one or more graphs.

- On the [Graph Types](types) dialog box, you can select a *defined* set of graphs.
- On the [Custom Graph Types](custom) dialog box, you can select *any* of the following graphs.
