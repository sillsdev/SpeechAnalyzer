On the [Graphs](overview) menu, you can point to **View** to do any of the following:

- To apply a legend, scales or segment boundaries to one or more graphs:
  - Point to **Legend**, **Time Scale**, or **Segment Boundaries**.
  - And then click **All Graphs**, **This Graph** (the [active graph](active-graph)), **Waveform Only**, or **No Graphs** (no scale or boundary bar).
- To expand or contract the displayed graphs that plot time on the horizontal axis, point to [Zoom](zoom), and then click:
  - **Step In** to display more temporal detail.
  - **Step Out** to display more of the waveform.
  - **Full** to display the entire waveform.
  - **Cursors** to display the waveform between the [begin and end cursors](begin-end-cursors).
- To change the vertical scale for the displayed graphs, point to [Magnify](magnify), and then click **x1**, **x2**, **x4**, or **Custom**.

- **Legend (y-axis)** sets which graphs display a *vertical* scale at the left side of the graph.
- **Time Scale (x-axis)** sets which graphs display a *horizontal* scale at the bottom of a graph.
- **Segment Boundaries** sets which graphs use vertical lines to display [segment boundaries](../edit/segment-boundaries).
