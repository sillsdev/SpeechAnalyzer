In Speech Analyzer, a *graph* is a window that displays a specific type of information about the active audio file (such as the pitch or spectrum). A graph includes the plot area and the X and Y axes. A *plot* is the data points or symbols contained in a graph that may be connected by a line (plot line), and the area that contains them (plot area). The *legend* is the part of a graph to the left of the plot area which includes the vertical axis.

On the **Graphs** menu, you can do any of the following:

- To select one or more [graph types](types/overview) to display for a file, click [Types](types/types).
- To specify parameters for the graphs displayed, click [Parameters](parameters/overview).
- To show or hide a transcription bar above the plot area of a graph, point to **Transcription Bars**, point to a type of transcription (for example, **Phonetic**), and then click **All Graphs**, **This Graph** (the [active graph](active-graph)), **Waveform Only**, or **No Graphs** (hide the transcription bar).
- To show or hide the **Legend**, **Time Scale**, and **Segment Boundaries**, or [Zoom](zoom) or [Magnify](magnify), point to [View](view).
- To add, remove, or record a graph overlay, point to [Overlay](overlay).
- To equalize the length of a phone in two different files, point to [Equalize Length](equalize-length).
- To vary the plot line of the active graph, point to [Drawing Style](drawing-style).
