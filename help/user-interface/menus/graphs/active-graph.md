title: Active graph
---

When two or more graphs are open, only *one* graph is *active* at a time. The title bar of the active graph has a particular color (for example, blue). If the title bar is dimmed, it is not the active graph.

Mouse clicks, menu selections, and key presses affect the active graph.

To make a graph active, do any of the following:

- Click the title bar of the graph you wish to make active.
- Press the **Shift+Tab** graph and file [shortcut key](../../shortcuts/graph) to switch from one graph to the next.

- Do *not* click in the plot area of a graph to make it active. This may change the position of the [begin and end cursor](begin-end-cursors).
