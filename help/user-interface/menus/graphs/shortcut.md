title: Graph shortcut menu
---

When you right-click the plot area of a graph, a shortcut menu appears. **Parameters**, **Transcription**, **View**, **Overlay**, and **Drawing Style** also appear on the [Graphs](overview) menu.

The following options appear on this menu. You can point to:

- [Layout](layout) - to select the icon showing the physical display of the graphs in the window.
- **Types** - to select a [graph type](overview) to *replace* the [active graph](active-graph).

The graph types *already selected* are checked and dimmed.

- **Retile** - to restore the positions of graphs expanded or reduced in size.
- **Snapshot Spectrogram** to update the current [Snapshot Spectrogram graph](types/snapshot-spectrogram) with changes made to the [Spectrogram graph](types/spectrogram).

#### ![](../../../images/000.png) **Important**

- If you select **Melogram** or **Staff** from the **Types** list, you *must* use the [Custom Graph Types](types/custom) dialog box to change to another graph type.

#### ![](../../../images/001.png) **Note**
- Not *all* menu options are active for all graphs.
- **Retile** does not work, if any one of the graphs have been expanded to full size
- **Retile** and **Retile Graphs** on the [Window](../window) menu work exactly the same.
