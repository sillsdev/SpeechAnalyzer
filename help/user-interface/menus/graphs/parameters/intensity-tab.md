title: Intensity tab, Graph Parameters
---

*Intensity* (or physical intensity) is the instantaneous energy delivered by a sound, relative to a fixed energy level. This is the acoustic correlate of the (psychoacoustic) loudness. The **Intensity** tab appears on the [Graph Parameters](overview) dialog box, if you select an [Intensity graph](../types/intensity).

To change the **Intensity** tab parameters, do the following:

1. Select an [active](../active-graph) [graph type](../types/overview).
1. Do one of the following:
   1. On the [Graphs](../overview) menu, click **Parameters.**
   1. Right-click in a plot area, and then click **Parameters**.
1. Click the **Intensity** tab.
1. In the **Display Scale** area, select either **Relative Intensity (dB)** or **Linear Magnitude (%).**

If you change the selection, the **Apply** button becomes active.

1. To save the settings and *not close* the dialog box, click **Apply**.
1. To save the settings and *close* the dialog box, click **OK**.
