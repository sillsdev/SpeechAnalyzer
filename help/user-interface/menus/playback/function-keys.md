title: Playback Function Keys Setup
---

You can designate a specific keyboard shortcut (for example, **Ctrl+F1**) to play recordings, using a combination of volume, speed, a part of the recording, and a repeat loop. Once you assign a combination to a keyboard shortcut, you can activate the combination by pressing the keyboard shortcut, or clicking a keyboard shortcut from the **Function Keys** list on the **Playback** menu.

This feature is particularly useful if certain combinations of volume, speed, and repetition are frequently used to playback files.

1. You can find the **Function Keys Setup** dialog box in either one of two ways:
   1. On the [Playback](overview) menu, click **Setup Function Keys**.
   1. On the [Player](player) dialog box, click **Fn-Keys**.
1. To change settings in the **Function Keys Setup** dialog box, do any of the following:
   1. In the **Ctrl+Fn** area, select a key combination to assign values.
   1. In the **Settings** area, adjust any of the following:

To adjust the play volume, move the **Volume** slider or arrows.

To adjust the play speed, move the **Speed** slider or arrows.

To hear a phrase, repeat it, and then immediately hear it again, select the **Repeat** check box. Use the slider or arrows to set the time between the repeats (in ms).

In the drop-down list, select an item showing what [portion of the recording to playback](overview).

1. To see if the current function key settings are correct, click **Run Test**.
1. Click **OK** to save the changes.
