title: Workbench Filter Selections
---

On the [Workbench](workbench) dialog box, you can select any of the following items to use as a filter.

- **Plain** performs *no filtering*.
- **Highpass** is a filter that *passes high frequencies well*, but attenuates (or reduces) frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency. This helps eliminate low-frequency hum and cassette motor noise.
- **Lowpass** is a filter that *passes low frequencies well*, but attenuates (or reduces) frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.
- **Bandpass** is a filter that *passes a range of frequencies* between the lower and upper cutoff frequencies well, but attenuates (or reduces) all other frequencies.
- **Reverb** adds reverb to the recording.
- **Echo** adds an echo to the recording.
- **Equation** allows you to enter an equation, f(x), to modify the recording as desired.

- A [70 Hz Highpass Filter](../file/recorder-settings) is automatically applied during recording. This setting can be turned off, if desired.
- The **Min Frequency** adjustment on the [Pitch tab](../graphs/parameters/pitch-tab) of the **Graph Parameters** dialog box only changes the vertical display scale of the pitch display, but does not act as a filter
