To display the **View** tab, on the **Tools** menu, click [Options](overview), and then change any of the following:

- In the **Mainframe** area, select or clear any of the following:
  - To display a vertical scroll bar to [zoom](../../graphs/zoom) the recording, select the **Scrollbar Zoom** check box
  - To display additional icons on the toolbar, select the **Advanced Tools** check box.
  - To display the graph layout taskbar, select the [Taskbar](taskbar) check box.
  - To display or hide the [status bar](../status-bar), select the **Statusbar** check box.
  - To move the [Tone](../../edit/transcription/guidelines) transcription bar *above* all other transcription bars, select the **Tone Above** check box.
- In the [Cursor Alignment](../../graphs/cursor-alignment) area, select or clear **Sample**, **Zero Crossing**, or **Fragment**.
- To select a *different* unit of display for the *first two* cursor display panes in the status bar, in the **Status Bar Units** area, select **Time**, **Samples**, or **Bytes**.

A *sample* is a value taken from an audio signal at a precise point in time. The sequence of these samples graphed over time is the waveform (or raw waveform).

- In the **Graphs** area, do any of the following:
  - Select a **Titlebar** style from the list.
  - To display vertical gridlines on the (*Y*-axis), select the **Vertical Gridlines** check box, and then select a style in the list.
  - To display horizontal gridlines on the (*X*-axis), select the **Horizontal Gridlines** check box, and then select a style in the list.
- In **Graph Fragment Update** area, do any of the following:

To see the changes, you must display a [Spectrum](../../graphs/types/spectrum) or [Formant Chart](../../graphs/types/formant-charts) graph, as well as a [Raw Waveform graph](../../graphs/types/raw-waveform).

- To update a graph display *after the begin or end cursor moves*, select **When cursor is set**.
- To update a graph display *as the begin cursor moves*, select **While cursor is moving**.

The **Animate at** check box activates.

- To show *animated progress* from the begin to the end cursor, select the **Animate at** check box.

To change the **frames per sec** animation-rate number, type a number or use the arrows.

To start animated movement toward the end cursor, position and click the begin cursor. The Spectrum and Formant Chart graphs change as the animation proceeds toward the end cursor.

#### ![](../../../../images/001.png)Â **Note**
- If you select a [Formant Chart](../../graphs/types/formant-charts) graph, **Animate** places a dot as the cursor passes through each fragment, *one dot at a time* for each fragment, and *retains the dots* on the graph.
