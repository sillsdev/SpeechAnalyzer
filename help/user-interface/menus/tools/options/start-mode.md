### **Reopen Files at Startup**
- On the [Startup tab](startup-tab) of the **Options** dialog box, select the **Reopen Files at Startup** check box to use the same set of graphs types, overlays, and parameters from the previous session of Speech Analyzer.
  - *The files must have been left open when Speech Analyzer last closed*.

If multiple files were open when Speech Analyzer closed, *they will all reopen*.

- This is very helpful if you select [graph types](../../graphs/types/overview), [layouts](../../graphs/layout), or [parameters](../../graphs/parameters/overview) for files, which are different from those [permanently](startup-tab) selected.
- When Speech Analyzer reopens, it bypasses the [Start Mode](../../../start-mode) dialog box.
- The **Show Startup Dialog** check box becomes inactive.

To select **Show Startup Dialog** check box, you *must clear* the **Reopen Files at Startup** check box.

- Any new *files* opened will have the *default* graph types, overlays, and parameters.

### **Show Startup Dialog**
- To see the **Start Mode** dialog box when Speech Analyzer reopens, select the **Show Startup Dialog** check box.
  - If the **Reopen Files at Startup** check box is selected, clear it.

**Show Startup Dialog** becomes available.

- If **Permanently** is selected, **User Specified** is checked on the **Start Mode** dialog box.
