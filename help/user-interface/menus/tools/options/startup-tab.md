title: Startup tab, Options
---

On the [Options](overview) dialog box, the **Startup** tab lets you save specific graph types, layouts, and parameters, when you [start](../../../start-mode) Speech Analyzer.

To save the [graph types](../../graphs/types/overview), layouts and parameters in the **Set Default View Template** area, do one of the following:

- For all files as a *permanent* default, click **Permanently**.
  - All files for all future sessions will start with the same [graph](../../graphs/overview) , [layouts](../../graphs/layout), and [parameters](../../graphs/parameters/overview), *until you change the settings again using this dialog box*.
  - To save changes to *colors and fonts*, you *do not need* to click **Permanently**.
  - To save new *graphs types and layouts*, you *do need* to click **Permanently**.
  - When you click **Permanently**, the **OK** button changes to **Close**.
- For all files, during the *current* Speech Analyzer sessions, click **Temporarily**.
  - All files for the *current session* will open with the same graph types, layouts, and parameters. **Temporarily** overrides previous **Permanently** parameters.
- To directly reopen any *previously worked-on files*, click [Reopen Files at Startup](start-mode).
- To display the [Start Mode](../../../start-mode) dialog box at each startup, click [Show Startup Dialog](start-mode).

- When you click **Permanently** or **Temporarily**, the selected *active graphs* display underneath the dialog button. The layout displays as a graphic to the right.
- These settings also apply to recording files.
