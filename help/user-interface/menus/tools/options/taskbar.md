To display the taskbar, on the **Tools** menu, select **Options**, and then click the [View tab](view-tab). The taskbar has two tabs, **Phonetic** and **Music**. The taskbar displays the name of the graph(s) and a graphic of the layout.

- To switch to a different set of graphs, on the taskbar, click an icon.

For example, click the **Waveform** icon on the taskbar, and the [Raw Waveform graph](../../graphs/types/raw-waveform) appears in the Speech Analyzer window.

- To add new combinations of graphs to the taskbar icons, do the following:
  - On the **Graphs** menu, click [Types](../../graphs/types/overview), and then click [Custom](../../graphs/types/custom).
  - Select the graphs you need, and then click **OK**.
  - Click **Save Current**.

The graph combination *now* appears in the **Graph Types** dialog box *and* on the taskbar.

- Click **OK**.
