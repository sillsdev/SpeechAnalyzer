To convert audio data to and from UTT and wav file formats, do the following:

1. On the [Tools](overview) menu, click **Audio Converter Program**.

    A **Speech Analyzer** dialog box appears.

1. Read the information, and then click **OK**.

    The **AudioCon Options** window opens.

    An Explorer window opens, displaying the default input folder of Audio Converter. If you copy files into the Explorer window, you will not need to browse to a different folder in Audio Converter.

    Copying files into this folder, however, might only be allowed for users in the administrator group. If you are not a member of the administrator group, you might need to browse to a different folder in Audio Converter to find the location of the audio files you wish to convert. 

1. In the **Input** area, do one of the following:
   1. To select a file to convert, search the **UTT Files** or **WAV Files** folders.
   1. When you locate the file to convert, select it in the list.

      The **Output** area becomes active, and the file information displays under the list.

1. In the **Output** area, do the following:
   1. Select the output **Sampling Rate (Hz)**, and **Sample size**.

      Using the **Options** menu, you can type *your own* sampling rate.

    1. In the **File Spec** area, select the output folder to write the converted file.
    1. If needed, type a new **File Name** in the text box.
    1. To add a job to the convert queue, click **Add**.
    1. To delete a job from the convert queue, select the job, and click **Delete**.
    1. To revise a job in the convert queue, select the job, and click **Revise**.
1. To convert the file, click **Convert**.

    The conversion bar displays the job progress, and the **AudioCon Job Status** box displays completed job messages.
