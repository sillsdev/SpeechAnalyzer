In the **Comments** tab on the [File Information](overview) dialog box, you can add annotation information. An annotation is an explanatory comment added to the wave file. You can add the following comment information about the active file:

- In the **Free Translation** area, type or enter the *intended sense* of the translation.
- In the **File Description** area, type or enter a *meaningful name* by which others may identify the recording.
- In the **Phonetic** area, the *complete* [phonetic transcription](../../edit/transcription/guidelines) displays, showing *all the individual* phonetic characters from each [segment](../../edit/segment).

- To avoid retyping the same source information when making a related set of recordings, select the **Add File Information** box on the [Recorder Settings](../recorder-settings) dialog box. All the source information saves, except the **Speaker** and **Reference**, until it changes or the check box is cleared.
