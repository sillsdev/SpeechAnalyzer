#### ![](../../../images/001.png) **Note**
- Recordings with waveform inversion, low signal level, or sound card offset problems can be corrected using the [Adjust Waveform](../tools/adjust-waveform) command on the **Tools** menu.
- Although recordings can be up to 4 GB, recordings of 2 or 3 minutes are suggested. A file recorded at 22 kHz [sampling rate](recorder-settings) with 16 bit samples will require about 2.6 MB per minute recorded.
- *If you need to use the slow Playback function*, keep recordings under ten seconds.
