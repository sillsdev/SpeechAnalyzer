In Speech Analyzer, you can record data in two ways:

- Record spoken utterances directly from microphone input to the computer.
- Record spoken utterances on an external recording device (for example, a MiniDisc recorder), and then record the playback from line input to the computer.

- If you use an an external recording device, it gives an immediate backup.

    A minidisk recorder is preferable, but a good quality personal stereo, with clean heads will do.

- Get the necessary cables and adapters, and connect them properly.
- Make sure a microphone is equipped with a wind screen.
- Place the microphone close to the mouth, but out of the oral and nasal airstreams. Headset microphones are helpful for maintaining placement
- Choose a recording location free of echo.
- Adjust the computer recording volume.

    Speech Analyzer provides a recording volume control on the [Recorder](record-new) dialog box. Make sure to set the recording level so that it rarely goes into the red. Do not set the recording level too low.
