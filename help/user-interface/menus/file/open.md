#### ![](../../../images/000.png) **Important**
- Transcription and annotation data is stored in a file with a [.saxml](saxml) extension in the same folder as the audio file.
- Music transcription data on the [Staff](../graphs/types/music/staff) is stored in a file with a .music.xml extension in the same folder as the audio file.
- If you open a read-only audio file, the title bar displays **(Read-only)** after the file name.
- Only .wav files stored in PCM format with mono recording in 8-bit or 16-bit sample size can be opened by Speech Analyzer. If you attempt to open .wav files in other formats, the program notifies you of the problem, and does *not* open the file.
- Speech Analyzer *cannot* open CECIL utterance files (with the .utt extension), but you can use the [AudioCon program](../tools/audio-converter) to convert them to .wav file format.
- All segmented files readjust when opened to set phonetic [segment boundaries](../edit/segment-boundaries) to the nearest [fragment](../graphs/fragment) (pitch period).

#### ![](../../../images/001.png) **Tip**
- You can open more than one file in Speech Analyzer. You can display a file in one or more [graphs](../graphs/overview).
- You can [register Speech Analyzer to open Wave Sound files](register) when you double-click them in Windows Explorer.
