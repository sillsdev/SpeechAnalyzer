You can export musical analysis information as a MusicXML, MIDI file, or with note codes in a text file.

1. Do one of the following:
   1. On the **File** menu, point to [Export](overview) and then click **Staff Notes (.MID)**.
   1. Right-click the [Staff](../../graphs/types/music/staff), and then click **Export to file**.
   1. On the **Staff**, click **Export**.

    The **Save As** dialog box appears.

1. In the **Save as type** box, select one of the following:
   1. To export the information as MusicXML, select **MusicXML file (\*.xml)**.

      **MusicXML** is an open, XML-based music notation file format. This is a richer format than MIDI. Many music notation packages, like Sibelius and Finale, support this interchange format.

    1. To export the information as a Type 0 MIDI file (single track), select **MIDI file (\*.mid)**.

        **MIDI** stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It is an electronic standard used for the transmission of digitally encoded music.

    1. To export the information as notes on a staff, select **Rich Text file (\*.rtf)**.
    1. To export the information as 7-character data strings identifying the pitch of each note which can be read back into Speech Analyzer at a later time, select **Text file (\*.txt)**.
1. If needed, in the **Save in** list, browse to a *different folder* to save.
1. In the **File name** box, enter or type a new name.
1. Click **Save**.
