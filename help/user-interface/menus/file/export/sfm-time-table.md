#### ![](../../../../images/001.png)Â **Note**
- After you select **Every** in the **Sample** area, the **Phonetic** check box is the only [transcription](../../edit/transcription/guidelines) available to export because in the current sample option, the segments do not match the segments used to enter the transcriptions.
- Sampling is usually done by **Phonetic Segments**, and **Calculations** at **Midpoint Value**, since transition areas can be in a state of change.
