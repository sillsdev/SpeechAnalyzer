*These keys work if you have zoomed in*. They shift the *entire* view of [transcription bars](../menus/edit/transcription/guidelines) and [graphs](../menus/graphs/overview) together left or right. We recommend displaying the [Position View graph](../menus/graphs/types/position-view), as you learn these shortcut keys.
