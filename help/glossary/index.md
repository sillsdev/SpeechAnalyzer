## **A**
**absolute pitch -** In acoustic phonetics, absolute pitch is the fundamental frequency of voiced speech. It is the acoustic correlate of the (psychoacoustic) pitch. See also [pitch](#pitch).

**air pressure** - See [pressure](#pressure).

**AMDF** - AMDF stands for Average Magnitude Difference Function. It is a measure of how well a signal matches a time-shifted version of itself, as a function of the amount of time shift. The match is calculated using subtraction (instead of multiplication, as in autocorrelation), which reduces computational time.

**annotation** - An annotation is an explanatory comment added to the wave file, such as language description, speaker name, or free translation.


## **B**
**bandpass filter** - A bandpass filter passes a range of frequencies between the lower and upper cutoff frequencies well, but attenuates (or reduces) all other frequencies.

**bandwidth** - The bandwidth is the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies a recording, filter, or formant contains. For a recording this is usually half the sampling frequency, unless a filtering or resampling operation has been applied.

[**bookmark character**]{#bookmark-character} - When you add a gloss bookmark, a bookmark character **!** appears to the left of the segment.


## **C**
**cepstrum** (cepstral) - The cepstrum is the fast Fourier transform of the log (decibel) spectrum. This separates the pitch and vocal tract components, which allows for smoothing.

**coarticulation** - Coarticulation is the influence successive speech sounds exert on each other, especially on the boundary between sounds.


## **D**
**Direct Edit** - Direct Edit is a method of transcribing, where the text is *typed directly* into a selected segment.


## **E**
**Ethnomusicology** - Ethnomusicology is the study of music in its cultural context; cultural musicology.

**Extensible Markup Language** - See [XML](#xml).


## **F**
**FFT** - FFT stands for fast Fourier transform. It is an efficient algorithm to decompose a sound into a spectrum of its frequency components.

**formant** - Formants (or formant frequencies) are the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The term is also used to refer to the peaks in the spectrum caused by these resonances. Individual formants are numbered in order of ascending frequency (as in F1, F2, F3, and so on).

**formant tracks** - Formant tracks are the lines on a spectrogram, showing the resonant frequencies (F1, F2, F3, and so on) selected. Formant tracks may be shown by themselves or overlaid on a spectrogram.

**fragment** - A fragment is the smallest significant unit of audio information in a sound.

In voiced sounds this is the pitch period. Fragment boundaries are located at the beginning of large positive pulses, usually pitch pulses. Similarly, in unvoiced sounds, fragment boundaries are often located at the beginning of major acoustic events like bursts.

**free translation** - Free translation is *the intended sense* of the actual translation. It may be entered in the **Comments** tab of the **File Information** dialog box.

**frequency** - Frequency is the number of times a repeated event occurs per unit of time.

**fundamental frequency** - The fundamental frequency (or f0) of a periodic signal is the inverse of the period length. The period is, in turn, the smallest repeating unit of a signal.


## **G**
**graph** - In Speech Analyzer, a graph is a window that displays a specific type of information about the active sound (such as the pitch or spectrum). A graph includes the plot area and the X and Y axes.


## **H**
**hertz** - Hertz is a unit of frequency. One hertz equals one cycle per second.

**highpass filter** - A highpass filter is a filter that passes high frequencies well, but attenuates (or reduces) frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency.


## **I**
[**intensity**]{#intensity} - Intensity (or physical intensity) is the instantaneous energy delivered by a sound, relative to a fixed energy level. It is the acoustic correlate of the (psychoacoustic) loudness. See also [relative intensity](#relative-intensity).

**interlinear** - Interlinear text *vertically aligns* an exported transcription text file. You can do this selecting **Interlinearize Transcriptions** in the **Export Speech format** dialog box.


## **J**

## **K**
**Keyman** - Tavultesoft Keyman is a computer program that allows you to type text in other languages without changing your physical keyboard (or system keyboard).


## **L**
**legend** - The legend is the part of a graph to the left of the plot area which includes the vertical axis.

**linear magnitude** - Linear magnitude is an option for displaying an intensity plot, calculated using the root-means-square (rms) value of the sound over a short time-period.

**loudness** - Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical intensity.

**lowpass filter** - A lowpass filter passes low frequencies well, but attenuates (or reduces) frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.

**LPC** - LPC stands for Linear Predictive Coding. It is a technique for representing the spectrum of sound in compressed form, based on a linear predictive model.

Only the gross features of spectrum are estimated by the model, resulting in a smoothed spectrum. The resonant frequencies of this model are sometimes used to estimate formant frequency locations


## **M**
**Melogram** - A Melogram is a graphical representation of the contour of a melody. In Speech Analyzer, the Smoothed Pitch graph is used to automatically generate this contour.

**MIDI** - MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It is an electronic standard used for the transmission of digitally encoded music. Also, the Standard MIDI File (SMF) format used to store MIDI codes.

**mixer** - The mixer is an option in the playback of a wave recording, which allows for the adjustment of the volume and balance.

[**music notation**]{#music-notation} - Music notation is a standardized system of writing for music, involving notes, clefs, sharps, flats, and other symbols.

**MusicXML** - MusicXML is a music notation file format. MusicXML is a richer format than MIDI. Many music notation packages, like Sibelius and Finale, support this interchange format.


## **N**
**normalize** - When you normalize a raw waveform, all the sample values in the file increase until the highest peak is at 100% (at the top of the waveform graph).

**notation** - See [music notation](#music-notation).


## **O**
**overlay** - An overlay is one or more audio files superimposed over another audio file, in the same plot area, for the purpose of comparing audio characteristics.


## **P**
[**pitch**]{#pitch} - Pitch is the perceived fundamental frequency of a sound. While the actual fundamental frequency can be precisely determined through physical measurement, it may differ from the perceived pitch because of overtones, or partials, in the sound.

**plot** - A plot is the data points or symbols contained in a graph that may be connected by a line (plot line), and the area that contains them (plot area).

[**pressure**]{#pressure} - Pressure is the force per unit area applied on a surface.

Sound waves cause pressure variations as they travel through air. Microphones convert these pressure variations into voltage signals. Computer sound cards digitize these signals for playback or storage in audio files.

**private cursor** - The private cursor is the blue cursor that you can move independently of the begin and end cursors on the Spectrum graph and Tonal Weighting chart.


## **Q**

## **R**
[**relative intensity**]{#relative-intensity} - Relative intensity is an option for displaying an intensity plot, calibrated against a sine wave with maximum amplitude of 100%. See also [intensity](#intensity).


## **S**
**sample** - A sample is a value taken from an audio signal at a precise point in time. The sequence of these samples graphed over time is the waveform (or raw waveform).

**sampling frequency** - The sampling frequency is the number of samples taken from an audio signal each second. It is also sometimes referred to as the sampling rate.

Higher sampling frequency often results in better quality recordings, at the cost of larger audio files.

**segment** - A segment is a region of sound containing an acoustic event, such as a phone, word, or musical note.

**semitone** - A semitone is a unit of frequency indicating the number of half-steps between a given frequency and a reference frequency. A semitone represents a half step on a musical scale.

**SFM Time Table** - An SFM Time Table is a standard format file that includes a backslash (*\)*, followed by a table marker. The table marker is then followed by a series of table entries. The table entry *first* shows the time followed by the selected information (segments, measurements, and so on) at that time.

**shortcut key** - Shortcut keys are individual keys and key combinations you can use to speed up your work. Most shortcut keys invoke commands that are also available on the menus and toolbar.

**snapshot** - You can preserve a snapshot (that is, make a copy) of the current Spectrogram graph before you zoom or adjust the parameters.

**Spectral Resolution** - Spectral Resolution indicates the amount of smearing that occurs in the frequency dimension of a spectrogram. The lower the Spectral Resolution, the clearer the fine spectral details that appear.

**spectrogram** - A spectrogram is a three-dimensional plot of the intensity of the frequency content of a signal as it changes over time. Usually the vertical axis indicates frequency, the horizontal axis indicates time, and the color or gray scale indicates intensity.

**spectrum** - A spectrum is a two-dimensional plot of the intensity of the frequency content of a signal.

Speech Analyzer provides FFT, smooth cepstrum, and LPC estimates of the spectrum.

**Standard Format** - Standard Format is a common text file format, used for identifying elements in transcription files. This includes markers (SFMs), beginning with a backslash and common name. These text files can be imported and exported, and read by Speech Analyzer, Toolbox, Shoebox, and other programs.

**status bar** - The status bar, located at the bottom of a Speech Analyzer window, displays information about the elements of an active plot.

[**syllable symbol**]{#syllable-symbol} - When you add a syllable segment, a syllable symbol ( **.** ) appears in the Phonetic transcription bar, just before the new segment

**Tonal Weighting chart** - A Tonal Weighting chart (TWC) is a histogram of the pitches in a waveform.

The TWC can be used to find such information as the tonal center and micro-tuning for a song.

**transcription** - A transcription is a text that is time-aligned with the audio data, such as the phonetic and phonemic transcriptions.


## **U**

## **V**

## **W**
**waveform** - A waveform is an audio recording and the graph of its samples (Raw Waveform graph). It can also refer to the audio file that contains the recording.

[**word break character**]{#word-break-character} - When you insert a work break in a segment, the word break character **#** appears to the left of the segment in the Gloss transcription bar.


## **X**
[**XML**]{#xml} - Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format. Speech Analyzer uses XML as a file format to import and export text files.
