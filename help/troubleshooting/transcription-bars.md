title: Transcription bars do not display characters correctly
---

For example, a transcription bar might not display the double vertical line character, U+2016, in the Doulos SIL font at a size of 20 points.

To change the font size, do the following:

1. On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.

   The **Options** dialog box appears.

1. Click the [Fonts](../user-interface/menus/tools/options/fonts-tab) tab.
1. When you have finished changing the font size, click **OK**.

- A *transcription* is a text that is time-aligned with the audio data, such as the phonetic and phonemic transcriptions.
