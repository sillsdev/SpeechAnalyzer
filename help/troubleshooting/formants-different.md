title: Formants are different in the LPC Spectrum
---

The formant values in the LPC [Spectrum](../user-interface/menus/graphs/types/spectrum) are calculated using a standard LPC analysis, while the [Spectrogram](../user-interface/menus/graphs/types/spectrogram) and [Formant Chart](../user-interface/menus/graphs/types/formant-charts) formant values are calculated using a modified LPC analysis (a bank of 1st order LPC tracking filters). The two approaches often result in different formant values.
