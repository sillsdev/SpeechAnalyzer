title: Feedback during recording
---

A loud tone may come from the speakers during recording. This is called *feedback* and is caused by speaker output feeding back into the microphone. If this happens while recording in Speech Analyzer, open Windows Volume Control and do the following:

1. On the **File** menu of Speech Analyzer, and click **Record New**.

    The **Recorder** dialog box appears.

1. Click **Input**.

    The **Recording Control** dialog box appears.

1. On the **Options** menu, click **Properties**.

    The **Properties** dialog box appears.

1. In the **Adjust volume for** area, select **Playback**, and then click **OK**.

    The **Volume Control** dialog box appears.

1. Under the **Microphone** area, select the **Mute** check box.
1. Close the dialog box

#### ![](../images/000.png) **Important**
- If you select the **Mute all** check box, in the **Volume Control** area, in the **Volume Control** dialog box, you *will not be able* to monitor your recording, even through headphones.

#### ![](../images/001.png) **Note**
- Be sure speakers *do not* face the microphone.
- Wear headphones when recording, so the microphone output does not playback through the speakers. If you wear headphones, you could turn off the speakers.
- Make sure the microphone is located *close to the mouth* of the speaker.
- Use a unidirectional microphone.
