title: Transcriptions were skipped during import
---

If you [imported](../user-interface/menus/file/import) a Standard Format .sfm file that included Reference, Tone or Phrase Level Transcriptions, they were skipped during import. This is a limitation in the current version of Speech Analyzer. It may be addressed in a future version.
