If you are unable to solve an unusual problem, try the following:

1. Exit Speech Analyzer, and then start Speech Analyzer again.
1. If step 1 does not work, exit Speech Analyzer, delete the sa3.psa file, and then start Speech Analyzer again.

C:\\Users\\*username*\\**Documents**\\Speech Analyzer\\sa3.psa
