title: What is new

Here are some significant changes since version 2.7 (June 2005).

### **New in Speech Analyzer**
- Unicode support and support for [Transcription Encoding Converters](../user-interface/menus/file/transcription-encoding-converters) for data from previous versions.

    For more information on the Web, you can go to:

    <http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html>

- MP3 and WMA support (read-only access).
- [Import](../user-interface/menus/file/import) and [export](../user-interface/menus/file/export/staff-notes) MusicXML.

### **Improved in Speech Analyzer**
- Formant processing.
- Transcriptions are now stored in a file with a [.saxml](../user-interface/menus/file/saxml) extension in the same folder as the audio file.
- [Help](../user-interface/menus/help) files and training materials have been improved and integrated with the program.
- Experimental features have been removed to avoid presenting confusing or misleading data.

### **Fixed in Speech Analyzer**
- Clicking the **Formant Tracks** button on the [toolbar](../user-interface/toolbar/toolbar) caused Speech Analyzer to stop responding.
- The Raw plot line of the [Spectrum graph](../user-interface/menus/graphs/types/spectrum) was excessively [smoothed](../user-interface/menus/graphs/parameters/cepstral-smoothing).
