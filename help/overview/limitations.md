Speech Analyzer is limited in the following ways:

- Although recording lengths are limited to 4 GB, *limit recordings to about three minutes*, because of processing times.
A file recorded at 22 kHz sampling rate with 16-bit samples requires about 2.6 MB per minute recorded.

- Speech Analyzer *only supports* mono recordings and single channel (Type 0) MIDI files.
