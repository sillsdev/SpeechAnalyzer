Speech Analyzer is a computer program for acoustic analysis of speech sounds.

You can use Speech Analyzer to do the following tasks:

- Perform [fundamental frequency](../user-interface/menus/graphs/types/pitch), [spectrographic](../user-interface/menus/graphs/types/spectrogram), and [spectral](../user-interface/menus/graphs/types/spectrum) analysis, and duration measurements.
- Add phonemic, orthographic, tone, and gloss transcriptions to phonetic [transcriptions](../user-interface/menus/edit/transcription/overview) in an interlinear format.
- Perform [ethnomusicological analysis](../user-interface/menus/graphs/types/music/analysis) of music recordings.
- Use slowed [playback](../user-interface/menus/playback/player), repeat loops, and [overlays](../user-interface/menus/graphs/record-overlay) to assist with perception and mimicry of sounds for language learning.
