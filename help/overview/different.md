title: How is Speech Analyzer different
---

Speech Analyzer is different from other software that plays and edits audio data.

You can do any of the following:

- Analyze the phonetics of spoken languages, especially tonal languages.
- Perform ethnomusicological analysis of music recordings.
- Add phonemic, orthographic, tone, and gloss transcription to [phonetic transcriptions](../user-interface/menus/edit/transcription/guidelines) in an interlinear format. 
- Analyze recordings up to 4 GB (overcoming the three second limitation of the WinCECIL software package).
